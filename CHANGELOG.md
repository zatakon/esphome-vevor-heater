# Changelog

All notable changes to the ESPHome Vevor Heater library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Automatic temperature control mode with PID controller
- Complete climate entity integration
- Anti-freeze mode
- Additional heater models support

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- **Daily Consumption Sensor "Unknown" State**: Sensor now retains its last value when heater is off
  - Value is loaded from flash on boot and published immediately
  - Sensor always shows a valid number instead of becoming "unknown"
  - Proper initialization in `setup()` and `load_fuel_consumption_data()`

### Changed
- **Configuration Simplification**: `injected_per_pulse_number` is now optional in YAML
  - Users don't need to include it unless they want to expose it as a configurable number in Home Assistant
  - Default values (min: 0.001, max: 1.0, step: 0.001) are set in Python configuration
  - Reduces YAML configuration complexity for basic usage

### Improved
- Better persistent storage handling for fuel consumption data
- Enhanced documentation for fuel consumption tracking

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Fuel Consumption Tracking**: Accurate monitoring based on pump frequency
  - Hourly consumption sensor showing instantaneous rate in ml/h
  - Daily consumption sensor with automatic midnight reset
  - Persistent storage saves data to flash every 30 seconds
  - Survives reboots by loading saved values from flash memory
  - Configurable `injected_per_pulse` parameter (default 0.022 ml)
  - Optional Home Assistant number entity for runtime calibration

### Fixed
- **Temperature Sensor Issues**:
  - Removed duplicate temperature sensor (only "Heat Exchanger Temperature" remains)
  - Fixed temperature scaling bug (was 10x too small - changed from `/100.0f` to `/10.0f`)
  - Proper temperature readings now displayed

### Changed
- Improved sensor naming consistency
- Enhanced logging for fuel consumption tracking
- Updated documentation with fuel tracking details

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Initial release of ESPHome Vevor Heater library
- **Core Features**:
  - UART communication with Vevor diesel heaters (4800 baud)
  - Manual control mode with power level adjustment (10-100%)
  - Automatic sensor creation with sensible defaults
  - Home Assistant integration
  
- **Sensors**:
  - Heat Exchanger Temperature
  - Input Voltage
  - Heater State (text sensor)
  - Power Level
  - Fan Speed
  - Pump Frequency
  - Glow Plug Current
  - State Duration
  - Cooling Down (binary sensor)

- **Control Methods**:
  - `turn_on()` / `turn_off()`
  - `set_power_level_percent()`
  - Template switch and number components for Home Assistant

- **Safety Features**:
  - Communication timeout detection
  - Frame validation and checksum verification
  - Proper state management
  - Failsafe shutdown on errors

- **Configuration Options**:
  - Automatic sensor creation (auto_sensors: true by default)
  - Manual sensor override capability
  - Configurable default power level
  - UART pin configuration with inversion support

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with examples
- Hardware connection diagrams
- Quick start guide
- API reference
- Troubleshooting section

## Version History Summary

- **v1.2.0** - Daily consumption sensor fix and configuration simplification
- **v1.1.0** - Fuel consumption tracking and temperature sensor fixes
- **v1.0.0** - Initial public release

---

## Breaking Changes

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- **Temperature Sensor Removed**: Duplicate temperature sensor was removed. Use "Heat Exchanger Temperature" sensor instead.
- **Temperature Values Changed**: Temperature readings are now 10x larger (correct scale). Update any automations that depend on temperature thresholds.

### From 1.1.0 to 1.2.0
- **No Breaking Changes**: This is a bug fix release. All existing configurations remain compatible.

---

## Migration Guides

### Migrating to v1.2.0
No migration needed - fully backward compatible with v1.1.0.

### Migrating to v1.1.0 from v1.0.0

**Temperature Sensor Changes:**
```yaml
# Old (v1.0.0) - REMOVE THIS
sensor:
  - platform: vevor_heater
    temperature:
      name: "Heater Temperature"

# New (v1.1.0+) - Already created automatically
# Use "Heat Exchanger Temperature" sensor
# No configuration needed - it's auto-created
```

**Temperature Threshold Updates:**
If you have automations using temperature:
```yaml
# Old threshold (v1.0.0)
below: 5.0  # This was actually 50Â°C

# New threshold (v1.1.0+)
below: 50.0  # Correct value
```
